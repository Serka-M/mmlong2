## Frequently asked questions about mmlong2

#### Will my sequenced dataset work with mmlong2?
* It is very situational whether mmlong2 is a good fit for your samples or project, but generally, the workflow is intended for highly complex metagenomes (e.g. soil, sewage sludge, human gut) and is not optimal for samples with very low microbial diversity (e.g. pure cultures, Zymo DNA Standard).
* Please keep in mind that mmlong2 is a long-reads only workflow, designed to work with Nanopore (about 1 % read error rate) or with PacBio HiFi (about 0.1 % read error rate) datasets. Short-read datasets can be used for mapping to improve genome recovery via differential coverage, but the workflow is not designed for short-read metagenomic assembly.
* It also recommended that the input for mmlong2 is at least 1 GB of sequenced data with multiple prokaryotic organisms.

#### Is read data pre-processing required by the workflow?
* It is highly recommended to perform read quality filtering (e.g. remove reads with less than Phred Q10 for Nanopore and Phred Q20 for PacBio HiFi as well as short-reads) and trim of read adaptor, barcode sequences before running mmlong2.

#### Is there a way to test mmlong2 without installing over 100 GB of databases?
* If you are only interested in getting the MAGs, check out [mmlong2-lite](https://github.com/Serka-M/mmlong2-lite), which is a lightweight version of the pipeline with an identical MAG recovery procedure and does not require large database installation.

#### Is there a way to avoid temporary files generated by the workflow?
* During a workflow run, temporary files might be generated and not deleted by Snakemake when the run finishes.
* By default, the current working directory is used to store these temporary files. Hence, it is recommended to have a directory dedicated to temporary files and provide it to mmlong2 through the `--temporary_dir` option.

#### What should be done when the mmlong2 workflow crashes?
* If the workflow crashes, try inspecting the Stdout and Snakemake logs for troubleshooting.
* The workflow can usually be resumed by re-running the same commands. 
* If you want to resume the workflow from a new installation of mmlong2, it is highly recommended to first run the workflow with the `--touch` option to mark the generated files against deletion.
* If the workflow still keeps crashing after several retries, feel free to post the error logs in the GitHub `Issues` section.

#### What about eukaryotic or viral genomes?
* At the moment, mmlong2 is not designed to perform genome recovery of viruses or eukaryotes. 
* Expansion of the binning features is planned for future releases.
