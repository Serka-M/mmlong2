# mmlong2
Automated long-read metagenomics workflow, using either PacBio HiFi or Nanopore sequencing reads as input to generate characterized MAGs.
mmlong2 is a continuation of [mmlong](https://github.com/SorenKarst/mmlong).

**Note:** At the moment, mmlong2 is an in-house pipeline at Aalborg University Bioservers. A distributable version of the pipeline is scheduled for a future release.
